# Path Finding with A* algorithm

This project is an implementation of the A* algorithm for a path finding application, in a 2 dimensional grid but taking into account the orientation of the robot.

## Context

A robot needs to move from a starting position with a certain orientation to a goal position with a certain orientation, while avoiding the obstacles.
The robot cannot do a 90Â° turn while staying at the same position. The robot can only move in 6 possible directions, according to the following movement model:

## Some results

## Usage

```python
cd path_finding/
python main_path_finder.py
```

The ```main_path_finder.py``` script is where you can modify the tests launched.
